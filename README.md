# üêç Snake Game

This project is a Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features classic snake gameplay where you control the snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid running into walls or yourself. The game includes logic for movement, collision detection, and score tracking, all brought to life with responsive UI and clean design. This project was created to practice game programming with vanilla JS and sharpen skills in DOM manipulation and interactive animation.
